## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

As this is my first project on frontendmentor.io, I've chosen a simple project to see how well can I apply everything I have learned up to this point.

### Continued development

In my future projects, I will try to build more complex web-sites with more layers to them. For example more dynamic sites that use React hooks. Once I feel like I've progressed enough, I want to start learning Typescript so I can implement it with React for a more pleasant and transparent coding experience.
